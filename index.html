                Over the past 18 months, everyone has become more comfortable online. People who formerly preferred
                conference calls and didn’t own a webcam became adept at seeing themselves on camera and even using
                emoji reactions. Let’s build upon that progress and improve your meeting facilitation so every virtual
                participant feels like your online meetings are a good use of time.
